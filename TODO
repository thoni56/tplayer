Filtering:
    ✔ Move tune-finding to separate class (like it was ;-) @done(19-03-16 12:19)
    ☐ Scrollable list, but keep filters on top
    Genres:
        ☐ Let the genre toggle buttons in filtering be activated initially, and push to filter
        ☐ Let found genres in the tunes create toggle buttons in filtering

        Random:
            ☐ Random (any)
            Random groups:
                ☐ Random genres - which should not be mathematically random
                ☐ Random tempo ranges
                ☐ Random count within groups
Settings:
    ☐ Select directory to (re-)load tunes from

System:
    ☐ Upgrade npm 'npm i -g npm'
    ☐ Give progress feedback when loading tunes (load a batch of tunes at a time? progress bar?)
    ☐ Switch to node-walk when finding tunes since it should be more standard (don't need the speed of 'walkdir')
