Overall:
    ✔ Go for a single page design, with filters and play info together for better UX @done(19-04-06 10:57)

Filtering:
    ✔ Move tune-finding to separate class (like it was ;-) @done(19-03-16 12:19)
    ✔ Scrollable list, but keep filters on top @done(19-03-17 21:30)
    ✔ Load tunes on startup (now requires reload for some reason) @done(19-04-05 17:54)
    Genres:
        ✔ Push to filter on genre @done(19-04-03 11:26)
        ✔ Keep selected genres in sync with filters by resetting both at mount-time @done(19-04-07 14:20)
        ☐ Let found genres in the tunes create buttons for filtering

            Random groups:
                ☐ Random genres - which should not be mathematically random
                ☐ Random tempo ranges
                ☐ Random count within groups
Settings:
    ☐ Select directory to (re-)load tunes from

    ☐ Fade settings
        ☐ Fade out on pause
        ☐ Fade in on play

Player:
    ✔ Play and Pause @done(19-03-18 22:55)
    ✔ Play next tune when finished @done(19-03-19 01:15)
    ✔ Highlight playing tune @done(19-03-19 08:29)
    ✔ Highlight should stay even when navigating back and forth @done(19-03-19 08:43)
    ✔ Show total time of tune @done(19-03-21 01:06)
    ✔ Next - start playing next tune @done(19-03-21 01:09)
    ✔ Show played time of tune @done(19-03-21 07:52)
    ✔ Progress Bar @done(19-03-21 07:52)
    ✔ BIG title, album etc, and smaller list @done(19-03-25 23:59)
    ✔ Click on tune to select and load @done(19-04-03 11:21)
    ✔ Fade in and out on play/pause @done(19-04-05 17:54)
    ☐ Scroll overflowed text horizontally
    ☐ Center playlist so that playing song is visible
    ☐ Next - if playing, play, else just move, now it is quite flakey (do we really want this?)
    ☐ Previous
    ☐ Formatting of PlayDisplay is wonky if any(?) field (except BPM) is empty or too long
    ☐ Double-click on tune to play
    ☐ Click on tune to select, need play to play?
    ☐ Normalize volume
    ☐ Remote control
        ☐ Play and pause using remote control
    ☐ BUG: Pushing forward or play/pause quickly causes player to come out of sync

Graphics:
    ✔ Add image for tunes not having embedded cover art @done(19-03-21 07:50)
    ✔ BUG: Is loading of cover art from tunes broken? @done(19-03-21 09:18)

System:
    ✔ Upgrade npm 'npm i -g npm' @done(19-03-20 22:27)
    ✔ Give progress feedback when loading tunes (load a batch of tunes at a time? progress bar?) @done(19-03-20 22:27)
    ☐ Prevent screen lock (https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/539/how-to-prevent-that-the-system-enters-in-suspension-sleep-mode-in-electron-framework)
    ☐ Switch to node-walk when finding tunes since it should be more standard (don't need the speed of 'walkdir')
