☐ Move tune-finding to separate class (like it was ;-)
☐ Let the genre toggle buttons in filtering be activated initially, and push to filter
☐ Add image for tunes not having embedded cover art
☐ Let found genres in the tunes create toggle buttons in filtering
☐ Switch to node-walk when finding tunes since it should be more standard (don't need the speed of 'walkdir')
