    ✔ Tune out and in when forwarding to next song @done(19-12-21 09:55)
    ☐ Previous
    ☐ Keep current song separate from the playlist so that we can play it even if it's not in the list
    ☐ Scroll overflowed text (title, album, etc) horizontally
    ☐ Center playlist so that playing song is visible
    ☐ Next - just move so that playing needs a play press (requires change in PlayerControls?)

    ☐ Double-click on tune to play
    ☐ Normalize volume
    ☐ Remote control
        ☐ Play and pause using remote control

Graphics:
    ✔ Add image for tunes not having embedded cover art @done(19-03-21 07:50)
    
System:
    ✔ Give progress feedback when loading tunes (load a batch of tunes at a time? progress bar?) @done(19-03-20 22:27)
    ☐ Prevent screen lock (https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/539/how-to-prevent-that-the-system-enters-in-suspension-sleep-mode-in-electron-framework)
    ☐ Switch to node-walk when finding tunes since it should be more standard (don't need the speed of 'walkdir')
        
Bugs:
    ✔ Is loading of cover art from tunes broken? @done(19-03-21 09:18)
    ✔ When finishing playing a tune it displays next tune, but continues to play the same @done(19-04-08 08:16)
    ✔ When continuing to next tune play icon is wrong @done(19-04-15 22:50)
    ✔ When tune is finished it does not always continue with next song, seems it only plays one second or so @done(19-04-15 22:50)
    ✔ Forward skipping with tune reload and play only works once @done(19-04-15 22:50)
    ☐ Pushing forward or play/pause quickly causes player to come out of sync
    ☐ When re-sorting the displayed tune should not change
