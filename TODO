Filtering:
    ✔ Move tune-finding to separate class (like it was ;-) @done(19-03-16 12:19)
    Genres:
        ☐ Let the genre toggle buttons in filtering be activated initially, and push to filter
        ☐ Let found genres in the tunes create toggle buttons in filtering
    BPM:
        ☐ Filter on range of BPM
    Sorting:
        ☐ Sort BPM
            ☐ Up
            ☐ Down
        Random:
            ☐ Random (any)
            Random groups:
                ☐ Random genres - which should not be mathematically random
                ☐ Random tempo ranges
                ☐ Random count within groups



Player:
    ☐ Play button
    ☐ Click to play

Graphics:
    ☐ Add image for tunes not having embedded cover art

System:
    ☐ Upgrade npm 'npm i -g npm'
    ☐ Give progress feedback when loading tunes (load a batch of tunes at a time? progress bar?)
    ☐ Switch to node-walk when finding tunes since it should be more standard (don't need the speed of 'walkdir')
